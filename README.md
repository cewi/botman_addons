Some extra stuff for botman 

## RasaNLU Middleware

Botman is a great tool for creating chatbots. For natural language processing (NLP or NLU) you can use dialogflow or wit.ai. If you don't want to pass the sentences of your users to google or facebook, Rasa can do a great job. The preferred solution would be to let Rasa mimic the Api of Wit.ai. But in the case that you need or want to use the native api of Rasa, botman doesn't ship with a middleware for that purpose.

WIP - Don't use for now!
